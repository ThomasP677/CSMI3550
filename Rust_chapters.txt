chapter 1:For the first chapter I succssefully installed rust on my laptop. I then created a project directory using the terminal 
chapter 2: for the second chapter I some simple rust methods which invovled asking the user for a guess and checking if the guess is correct
chapter 3: In this chapter I leanred about certian errors that can occcure whith data types in rust 
chapter 4: In this chapter I learned how stacks and heaps are important to Rust and how ownership rules operate.
chapter 5: Here I learned how to intialize structs and how to use them.
chpater 6: An enum is a way of defining a value which can be one of a possible set of values. Also, leanred how to allocate each value in an enum to another value
chapter 7: The first thing that was intorduced was a data type called a crate which can come in two forms: a binary crate or a library crate. Binary crates are programs you can compile to an executable that you can run, such as a command-line program or a server. A bundle of crate is called a package.
chapter 8: Learned how to create vectors and what certain sintax is associated with them.
chapter 9: Learned how to read certain error messages to help with debugging. Also learned how to deal with error messages that do not have a direct output.
chapter 10: This chapter explained generic design methodes such as finding duploicates and the maximum value in a list.
chapter 11: This chapter explained how to right test functions. Some of these functions incude the assert_eq methode.
chapter 12: This chapter explained how to integrate the command line with rust. Some of these integrations include reading files
chapter 13: Ths chapter dealved into different kinds of fucntions. Rust’s closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions. An iterator is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item and determining when the sequence has finished.
chapter 14: In this chapter we discussed more advanced uses for Cargos and Crates. Some of these uses incluid the build and install commands. The install command can be used to download binary crates.
chapter 15: A pointer is a general concept for a variable that contains an address in memory. This address refers to, or “points at,” some other data. An example of this is the Box<T>, varibale type which is used to point to a heap.
chapter 16: This chapter discussed threading and how to use it. In order to create a thread in rust you have to use the spawn function.
chapter 17: This chapter delved into object oriented programming in rust. In rust,object-oriented programs are made up of objects. An object packages both data and the procedures that operate on that data. The procedures are typically called methods or operations.
chapter 18:
